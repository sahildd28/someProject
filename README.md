This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
This is a little homepage I created for my girlfriend to use, it just has some links and pulls weather data right on to the webpage.

WeatherData is provided by OpenWeather, and it is wrapped in a serverless function.
<br/>It also shows a random compliment, which is also pulled from a serverless function.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
